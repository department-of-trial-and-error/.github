# Department of Trial and Error

>[!WARNING]
> Always cooking… barely following recipes.

The Department of Trial and Error (_DOTAE_) is a place for projects that don’t need a business case or a roadmap. Some might be useful, some might not. Most will exist simply because they were interesting enough to build. No strict themes, no promises—just a steady stream of ideas, experiments, and things that probably worked well enough.

If you’re expecting perfection, you’re in the wrong place. If you’re here for fun, curiosity, problem-solving, and the occasional overcomplicated solution to a simple problem, then enjoy while it is worth enjoying.
